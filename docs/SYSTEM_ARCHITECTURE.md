# System Architecture Document
## ATS Resume Analyzer

_Date: 2026-03-20_

## 1) Architecture goals

- Keep feature delivery fast for a 3-developer team.
- Separate concerns clearly across frontend, backend, and data layers.
- Support async AI analysis without blocking user interactions.
- Preserve a migration path from single-instance demo to production-style deployment.

## 2) C4 — Level 1 (System Context)

## 3) C4 — Level 2 (Container View)

```mermaid

      FE[React + Vite SPA\n(Zustand, Axios)]
    end

    subgraph Server
      API[Express API\nRoutes + Middleware]
      Q[Analysis Queue/Worker\n(Bull-style async processing)]
      SVC[Service Layer\n(Auth, Resume, AI, File)]
    end

    subgraph Data
      DB[(Prisma + SQLite/PostgreSQL)]
      UP[(uploads/resumes)]
    end

## 5) Key runtime sequences

### 5.1 Analyze uploaded resume (async)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant FE as Frontend
    participant API as Backend API
    participant Queue as Analysis Queue
    participant Worker as Job Processor
    participant AI as OpenRouter
    participant DB as Database

    User->>FE: Upload resume + job description
    FE->>API: POST /api/analyze
    API->>Queue: enqueue(job)
    API-->>FE: 202 Accepted + jobId

    loop poll status
      FE->>API: GET /api/analysis/{jobId}/status
      API-->>FE: queued|active|completed
    end

    Queue->>Worker: start job
    Worker->>AI: analyze resume text
    AI-->>Worker: analysis JSON
    Worker->>DB: persist resume + analysis
    Worker-->>Queue: completed
```

### 5.2 Access token refresh

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant FE as Frontend Axios
    participant API as Auth API
    participant DB as RefreshSession

    FE->>API: API call with expired access token
    API-->>FE: 401
    FE->>API: POST /api/auth/refresh (refreshToken)
    API->>DB: validate session/hash/revocation
    API->>DB: rotate/revoke old session
    API-->>FE: new access + refresh tokens
    FE->>API: retry original request
    API-->>FE: 200 success
```

## 6) Deployment architecture

## Current (project/demo)
- Single machine/container friendly.
- Frontend can be served via backend static build.
- Local file storage for resume uploads.
- SQLite default.

## Target (production-like)

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    LB[Reverse Proxy / Load Balancer]
    LB --> API1[API Instance 1]
    LB --> API2[API Instance 2]
    API1 --> REDIS[(Redis)]
    API2 --> REDIS
    API1 --> PG[(PostgreSQL)]
    API2 --> PG
    API1 --> OBJ[(Object Storage)]
    API2 --> OBJ
```

## 7) Trust boundaries

1. **Browser ↔ API boundary**
   - Untrusted input enters here.
   - Must enforce auth, validation, sanitization.

2. **API ↔ AI provider boundary**
   - External model responses are untrusted.
   - Must parse/validate response schema before persistence.

3. **API ↔ File system boundary**
   - Uploaded files must be content-validated and user-scoped.

4. **Config/secrets boundary**
   - Secrets must never be embedded in source/image layers.

---

## 8) Cross-cutting quality concerns

### Security
- JWT + refresh-session model implemented.
- Input/file sanitization present.
- Immediate priority: remove hardcoded secrets from Docker artifacts.

### Reliability
- Async queue processing for heavy workloads.
- Graceful shutdown hooks present.
- Immediate priority: remove destructive DB reset startup commands.

### Performance
- Pagination and filtering patterns in backend.
- API retries/refresh handling in frontend.
- Immediate priority: optimize auth DB checks and use distributed limiter for scale.

### Observability
- Logging present.
- Future: metrics, tracing, and alerting layers.

---

## 9) Architecture decisions (recommended ADRs)

1. **ADR-001:** Async queue for AI analysis.
2. **ADR-002:** Refresh-session rotation strategy.
3. **ADR-003:** SQLite (dev) + PostgreSQL (scale path).
4. **ADR-004:** Distributed limiter and cache strategy (Redis).
5. **ADR-005:** Secret management policy for containerized runs.

---

## 10) Ownership map for 3 developers

- **Backend owner:** auth/session, analysis pipeline, DB interactions.
- **Frontend owner:** dashboard flows, resilience, accessibility, UX.
- **Platform owner:** Docker/CI, secrets policy, deployment/test automation.

This split minimizes merge conflicts and aligns with existing code module boundaries.
